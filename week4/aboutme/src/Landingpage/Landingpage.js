Hey.....!!! I would like to introduce about myself.

My full name is Gogula HemaChand Yadav and I am from Nellore. I came from the middle class family and I am the only son to my parents. My favorite food is Fish, "Biryani", and what my mother cook.My favorite colors are red and green. I like red because it is symbolize fierce but for green symbolize as peaceful.

My hobby is to surf through the Net play games like badminton and ride a bicycle.The main thing I do with my laptop all the time is "coding" which shows my passion towards the coding I have pasrticipated in many coding events like Code arena,CodeVita. My brother taught me how to ride and how to play a badminton. When I was in primary and secondary school I joined the badminton club because it was my favorite sports.

who you do not know me, they always says that i am very arrogant and fierce. Yes it is true that I am very fierce if there is any work that I have to do but it is not true that I am arrogant, I think that the reason why people says like that because they saw that I am silent in the class and do not talk so much. If you guys know me I am very sociable. That all about myself.
